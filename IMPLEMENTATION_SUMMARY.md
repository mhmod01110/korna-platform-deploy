# Implementation Summary: Project Exam Fixes and Notification System

## Overview
This implementation addresses two main requirements:
1. **Fix Project Exam Handling** - Improved project exam submission and admin marking
2. **Notification System** - Complete notification system for both admin and students

## 1. Project Exam Fixes and Multiple File Upload

### Changes Made:

#### A. Database Schema Updates (`src/models/Submission.js`)
- **Added support for multiple files** in project submissions
- **New Schema Structure**:
  ```javascript
  // New: Array of files instead of single file
  files: [projectFileSchema]
  
  // Legacy fields maintained for backward compatibility
  fileUrl: String,
  fileName: String,
  fileSize: Number,
  fileType: String
  ```
- **Added grading history** for audit trail of all grading activities

#### B. Controller Enhancements (`src/controllers/examController.js`)
- **Enhanced `submitProjectExam` function**:
  - Supports both single file (backward compatibility) and multiple files
  - Validates file types and sizes (50MB per file, max 10 files)
  - Expanded supported file types: PDF, ZIP, RAR, Office docs, images, videos, audio, text files
  - Better error handling and user feedback

- **Improved project grading**:
  - Enhanced feedback system with templates
  - Better validation and error messages
  - Audit trail for grading history

#### C. User Interface Improvements
- **Project Submission View** (`src/views/exam/project-submission.ejs`):
  - Multiple file selection with drag-and-drop support
  - Real-time file validation and preview
  - Enhanced file size and type validation
  - Better user feedback for file selection

- **Admin Grading Interface** (`src/views/exam/grade-project.ejs`):
  - Display all submitted files with download links
  - Quick feedback templates for common responses
  - Auto-suggest marks based on feedback type
  - Enhanced validation and user experience

## 2. Comprehensive Notification System

### Features Implemented:

#### A. Database Model (`src/models/Notification.js`)
- **Comprehensive notification schema** with:
  - Multiple notification types (exam published, project submitted/graded, etc.)
  - Priority levels (LOW, NORMAL, HIGH, URGENT)
  - Rich data storage for context
  - Expiration and scheduling support
  - Read/unread status tracking

#### B. Notification Controller (`src/controllers/notificationController.js`)
- **Complete CRUD operations** for notifications
- **Automatic notification triggers**:
  - When exams are published → notify students
  - When projects are submitted → notify teachers
  - When projects are graded → notify students
  - Deadline reminders → notify relevant users

#### C. User Interface Components
- **Notification Dropdown** in header:
  - Real-time unread count badge
  - Quick preview of recent notifications
  - Mark as read functionality
  - Direct links to relevant pages

- **Full Notification Page** (`src/views/notifications/index.ejs`):
  - Tabbed interface (All, Unread, Exams, Projects)
  - Pagination support
  - Bulk operations (mark all as read)
  - Individual notification management

#### D. Background Services (`src/utils/cronJobs.js`)
- **Automated tasks**:
  - Daily deadline reminders at 9 AM
  - Cleanup expired notifications at midnight
  - Archive old read notifications weekly

## 3. Integration and System Enhancements

### A. Route Integration
- Added notification routes to main application (`app.js`)
- Properly integrated with existing authentication middleware

### B. Real-time Updates
- JavaScript-based polling for notification updates
- Automatic UI updates for unread counts
- Seamless user experience without page refreshes

### C. Backward Compatibility
- All existing single-file project submissions continue to work
- Legacy data structures maintained alongside new features
- Gradual migration path for existing data

## 4. Technical Specifications

### File Upload Enhancements:
- **Maximum file size**: 50MB per file
- **Maximum files**: 10 per submission
- **Supported formats**: 
  - Documents: PDF, DOC, DOCX, PPT, PPTX, XLS, XLSX
  - Archives: ZIP, RAR
  - Images: JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG

### Notification Types:
- `EXAM_PUBLISHED` - New exam available
- `EXAM_GRADED` - Exam results ready
- `PROJECT_SUBMITTED` - Student submitted project
- `PROJECT_GRADED` - Project has been graded
- `SUBMISSION_RECEIVED` - General submission confirmation
- `DEADLINE_REMINDER` - Approaching deadline warning
- `SYSTEM_ANNOUNCEMENT` - System-wide announcements
- `GRADE_UPDATED` - Grade changes
- `FEEDBACK_RECEIVED` - New feedback available

## 5. Installation and Setup

### Required Dependencies:
```bash
npm install node-cron
```

### Environment Setup:
